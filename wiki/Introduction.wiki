#summary Introduction to Software Construction Toolkit

= Introduction =

What is the Software Construction Toolkit?
  * A toolkit for building applications.
  * Open-source, so you can use it for building open-source products.
  * Based on the open-source SCons build tool.
    * Written in python; easily extended by writing tool modules.
    * Documented.
    * Tested.
    * Your friend!

A sample of features:
  * Build Windows, Linux, Mac desktop platforms with a single set of build files.
  * Support for parallel (multi-processor) builds on all platforms.
  * Support for distributed builds via distcc and Incredibuild.
  * Generate Visual Studio solution and project files.

Why is the only tool in the toolkit a hammer?
  * If you have a hammer, what other tools do you need?
  * Once you start using it, everything looks like a nail - it's flexible enough you want to use it for all your build needs.
  * Getting hammered is just as much fun for project builds as it is for developers.
  * Because typing 'software_construction_toolkit.bat' would be too painful.
